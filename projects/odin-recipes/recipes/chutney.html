    <img src="../images/chutney.webp">
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>I don't even know what this is but I googled things to go with our delicious <a href="../recipes/popovers.html">popovers</a> so here you are.</p>
    <p>Enhance the enjoyment of your popovers with a flavorful and tangy spiced fruit chutney. This chutney is a perfect accompaniment that adds a burst of sweet, spicy, and tangy flavors to complement the light and airy popovers. With a combination of fruits, aromatic spices, and a hint of acidity, this chutney will elevate your popover experience to a whole new level.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups mixed fruits (such as apples, pears, peaches, or mangoes), peeled and diced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup raisins</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped red onion</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cloves</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional, for a touch of heat)</li>
        <li>Pinch of salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium-sized saucepan, combine the mixed fruits, brown sugar, apple cider vinegar, raisins, red onion, ground ginger, ground cinnamon, ground cloves, red pepper flakes (if using), and a pinch of salt.</li>
        <li>Place the saucepan over medium heat and stir to combine all the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Bring the mixture to a gentle boil, then reduce the heat to low and let it simmer uncovered for about 30-40 minutes, or until the fruits have softened and the chutney has thickened.</li>
        <li>Stir occasionally during the cooking process to prevent sticking and to ensure the flavors are evenly distributed.</li>
        <li>Once the chutney has thickened to your desired consistency, remove the saucepan from the heat and let it cool completely.</li>
        <li>Transfer the chutney to a clean, airtight jar or container. It can be refrigerated and stored for up to two weeks.</li>
        <li>Serve the spiced fruit chutney alongside warm popovers. The tangy and sweet flavors of the chutney will beautifully complement the popovers' texture and add a delightful zing to each bite.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Note: Feel free to adjust the spices and sweetness according to your taste preferences. You can also experiment with different combinations of fruits to create your unique flavor profile.</p>
