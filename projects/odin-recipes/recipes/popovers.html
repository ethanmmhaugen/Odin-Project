    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 cup whole milk, at room temperature</li>
        <li>4 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and slightly cooled</li>
        <li>cooking spray or additional melted butter to grease the pan</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 450°F (230°C). Place the popover pan in the oven as it preheats. The popover pan must be hot before you pour the batter into it.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour and salt until well combined.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, beat the eggs until frothy. Then add the milk and melted butter, and whisk until thoroughly combined.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, whisking continuously. Mix until the batter is smooth and no lumps remain. It's okay if the batter is slightly thin.</li>
        <li>Remove the hot popover pan from the oven, and carefully spray it with non-stick cooking spray or brush it with melted butter to grease each cup.</li>
        <li>Quickly pour the batter into each cup, filling them about 3/4 full.</li>
        <li>Place the filled popover pan back in the oven and bake at 450°F (230°C) for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>After 20 minutes, reduce the oven temperature to 350°F (175°C) without opening the oven door. Continue baking for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the popovers have risen tall and have turned golden brown.</li>
        <li>Once done, remove the pan from the oven, and immediately transfer the popovers to a wire rack to cool slightly. This will help maintain their crispness.</li>
        <li>Serve the popovers warm. They're best enjoyed fresh out of the oven. You can serve them with butter, jam, or honey for a sweet twist. They also pair wonderfully with savory accompaniments like roasted meats or sautéed vegetables.</li>
